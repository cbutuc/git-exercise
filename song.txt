[Verse 1]
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burnin' like embers, falling tender
Long before the days of no surrender years ago
And well you know?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
'cause I don't know how

[Chorus]
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you, oh-oh
Tell me are they lost on you? Oh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
